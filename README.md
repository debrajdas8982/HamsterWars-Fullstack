# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App]

# Project Parts
This project has two parts. One is frontend part and the other is backend part. This project is called HamstersWar-Fullstack which is the part of the final project submission of my course Effective Frontend Development.
1. Frontend part is developed by React with React-router. This is a good experience of working with React. 
2. The second part means the Backend part is developed with node.js and express.js. 

I use Heroku to deploy the web-server online. 

# Main Functionalities
In the Battle section one can choose the most cutest hamster and vote for it. So the cutest hamster will win and the next match with other two random hamster initiates so the match continues.
Gallery section has 4 different parts. Anyone can add a hamster, delete a hamster see the detail information of the particular hamster and can see whom the particular hamster has defeated.

It is a good experience working with this project.
